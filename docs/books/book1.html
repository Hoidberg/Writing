<p><em>After waiting, it was finally our chance to swim with the dolphins!</em> We walked up to the pool and got in, after a while of waiting in the pool it was finally my turn to do the dolphin thing. after taking the picture I swam to the middle and the dolphin came over, <em>I grabbed the fin of the dolphin</em> and the dolphin swam back to the place where we were sitting and after another while of waiting we were finally done.</p>
