<h1 align="center">By: <small>Hoidberg (Charlie West-Toebe)</small></h1>

<p>We were waiting in the seats in the locker room at gulf world, after a while of waiting it was finally time for our group to swim with the dolphins, I was so excited to finally swim with the dolphins.
we then walked up to the life jackets and put them on.
after putting them on we then walked to the seats and waited. <em>After waiting, it was finally our chance to swim with the dolphins!</em> We walked up to the pool and got in, and the instructor gave us instruction on what not to do, we all were asked to lean against the wall and put our hands out, then, the dolphin swam under all of our hands and it felt like wet rubber, after a while of waiting in the pool it was finally my turn to do the dolphin thing, I swam to the side and they took some pictures of me and the dolphin doing tricks, I swam to the middle and the dolphin came over, <em>I grabbed the fin of the dolphin</em> and the dolphin swam back to the place where we were sitting and after another while of waiting we were finally done.</p>
